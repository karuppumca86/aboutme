        <h2 id="philosophy-heading" class="section__title">My Approach to Architecture</h2>
        
        <p>
          I've spent over fourteen years building software systems, and the most important lesson 
          I've learned is that architecture isn't about choosing the right framework or following 
          the latest patterns. It's about understanding the problem space deeply enough that the 
          right structure emerges from the constraints.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Every architectural decision is a bet on the future. Some bets are cheap to reverse—you 
          can switch a library, refactor a module, or rewrite a microservice. Other bets are 
          expensive: database schemas, API contracts, fundamental data models. The art of 
          architecture is knowing which decisions fall into which category and investing your 
          thinking time accordingly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I've seen too many systems fail not because of technical mistakes, but because of 
          organizational ones. The best architecture in the world doesn't matter if the teams 
          building it can't coordinate effectively, or if the incentive structures push people 
          toward local optimizations that harm the whole. Good architecture is as much about 
          people and communication as it is about code.
        </p>

            <h3 class="principle__title">Understand Before You Solve</h3>
            <p class="principle__description">
              The most common architectural mistake is solving the wrong problem. I spend more time 
              than most people expect asking questions, mapping constraints, and understanding the 
              actual goals before proposing solutions. The right architecture often becomes obvious 
              once the problem is properly understood.
            </p>
            <p class="principle__tradeoff">
              <strong>Trade-off:</strong> This approach requires patience from stakeholders who want 
              to see progress quickly. I've learned to balance thorough understanding with delivering 
              early, incremental value.

            <p class="principle__description">
              Systems change. Requirements change. Understanding changes. The goal isn't to design 
              the perfect system today—it's to design a system that can evolve as you learn more. 
              This means favoring loose coupling, clear boundaries, and reversible decisions 
              wherever possible.
            </p>
            <p class="principle__tradeoff">
              <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Designing for change can add apparent complexity upfront. 
              I'm careful to distinguish between accidental complexity (waste) and essential 
              complexity (investment in future flexibility).

            <h3 class="principle__title">Make the Right Thing the Easy Thing</h3>
            <p class="principle__description">
              Good architecture shapes behavior. When the easiest path through a system also 
              happens to be the correct path, you don't need to rely on discipline or 
              documentation—the structure itself guides people toward good outcomes.
            </p>
            <p class="principle__tradeoff">
              <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Building paved roads takes time. Sometimes you need to 
              ship now and build the roads later. The key is knowing when you're accumulating 
              technical debt and having a plan to address it.

            <h3 class="principle__title">Optimize for Understanding</h3>
            <p class="principle__description">
              Code is read far more often than it's written. Systems are debugged far more often 
              than they're designed. I prioritize clarity over cleverness, explicit over implicit, 
              and boring technology over exciting technology when the problem doesn't demand otherwise.
            </p>
            <p class="principle__tradeoff">
              <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Sometimes the most understandable approach isn't the 
              most performant or the most elegant. I make conscious trade-offs between clarity 
              and other qualities, documenting why when the choice isn't obvious.

        <h2 id="problems-heading" class="section__title">Problems I Enjoy Solving</h2>
        
        <p>
          Not all problems are equally interesting to me. I'm drawn to challenges that require 
          balancing multiple competing concerns, understanding complex systems, and finding 
          solutions that are both technically sound and organizationally viable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I find particular satisfaction in <strong>legacy modernization</strong>—taking systems 
          that have grown organically over years and finding paths to improve them without 
          stopping the business. These problems require deep technical knowledge, political 
          navigation, and the patience to execute multi-year transformations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm also energized by <strong>platform challenges</strong>: building internal systems 
          that other teams use as foundations. The puzzle of making something that's powerful 
          enough for experts but accessible enough for newcomers, flexible enough to handle 
          edge cases but opinionated enough to guide toward good defaults—that's the kind of 
          design challenge I find genuinely engaging.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Finally, I enjoy problems at the <strong>intersection of technology and organization</strong>. 
          How do you structure a system so that teams can work independently? How do you design 
          APIs that create good incentives? How do you build consensus around architectural 
          direction without slowing everything down? These sociotechnical problems are often 
          harder—and more impactful—than purely technical ones.
