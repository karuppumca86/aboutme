          <p>
            The biggest challenge wasn't the distributed systems complexity itself—it was 
            helping the team develop intuition for distributed failure modes. We invested 
            heavily in chaos engineering and game days, which paid dividends when real 
            incidents occurred. Teams that had practiced failure scenarios recovered faster 
            and with less stress.

            and navigating the politics of centralized vs. decentralized control. Success 
            required as much time with stakeholders as with code.

            Data projects live or die based on organizational buy-in, not technical excellence. 
            Getting data owners to take responsibility for quality required creating incentive 
            structures and making quality visible. The technical challenge of building the 
            platform was dwarfed by the cultural challenge of improving data ownership.

            The strangler fig pattern works, but it requires patience and discipline that 
            most organizations struggle to maintain. The key was celebrating incremental 
            wins and making progress visible to leadership. We also learned that the best 
            way to build trust after failed modernization attempts is to start with small, 
            low-risk extractions and demonstrate success before tackling the hard parts.
