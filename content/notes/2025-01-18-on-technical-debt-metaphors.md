The "debt" metaphor for shortcuts in code is useful but imprecise. Financial debt has predictable interest rates. You know exactly what it will cost you to defer payment.

Technical debt is more like deferred maintenance on a house. You might defer fixing the roof for years without consequence—or a storm could come tomorrow and cause catastrophic damage. The interest rate is unpredictable.

This matters because it changes how you should think about prioritization. Financial debt with high interest should always be paid first. But with technical debt, you sometimes want to address low-probability, high-consequence risks before steady-state annoyances.

The best engineering managers I know are good at assessing both the *likelihood* of technical debt causing problems and the *severity* when it does.
